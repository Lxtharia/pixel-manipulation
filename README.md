# pixel-manipulation
Pixelsorting and glitch effects written in C


```pixel-effect.out <input-file> [<output-file>]```

it uses image magick to convert the images, so better have that installed

you can change which .so shared library  it uses by including a different .so in /effects

yeah

you can use the .so files with [swaylock-effects](https://github.com/mortie/swaylock-effects) (`--effect-custom <path/effect.so>`)

have fun (i sure have!)
